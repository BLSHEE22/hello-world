# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, I'm Brendan Sheedy and I'm just getting started with GitHub. Currently, I am working on a circuit in Logisim that generates original music completely at random. My goal is to translate the circuit into code (Java, Python, etc.) and implement machine learning so that the engine can be taught to compose in certain styles or genres.
